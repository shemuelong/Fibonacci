# Fibonacci
A program demonstrating different ways of programming the Fibonacci Sequence

There are three functions in this program. 

fibonacci() is the simplest of the three and is our basic implementation using recursion.
fibonacciAddition() would be our "brute force" method of calculating one individual term of the sequence.
dynamic_fib() uses an array to store past values of the sequence.

In the main program, we see first see that our simple fibonacci comes short in terms of time complexity. Past the
